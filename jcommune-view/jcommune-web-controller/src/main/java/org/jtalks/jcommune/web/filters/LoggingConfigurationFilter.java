/**
 * This filter binds a current user to the thread therefore allowing to show her username in each line of logs (which is
 * helpful when it comes to combining several actions of user and looking after the logs). It's implemented by using
 * features like {@link org.slf4j.MDC}, we need to register a username in the beginning and then unregister it in the
 * end of the request so that the memory doesn't leak. <p>Note, that if a user is anonymous, we don't have means to
 * distinguish between them except by using a session id, and that's what we're actually doing. </p>See logger
 * configuration to see where the username is going to appear, for instance in log4j it may look like {@code
 * %X{userName}}.
