 * <p>Extended version of the usual Spring's {@link PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer} that looks into Tomcat JNDI first.
 * Note, that JNDI is the highest priority and if property was found there, then nothing can override it. If property
 * wasn't found there, then usual algorithm of {@link PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer} is used.</p> <b>Justification</b>:
 * in order to simplify the deployment in different environment like DEV, UAT, we'd like to change Tomcat's {@code
 * $CATALINA_HOME/Catalina/localhost[jtalks_app.xml]} file rather than unzip the war file and change properties there.
 * We certainly don't want to use OS env vars because they are shared between different applications, moreover keeping
 * them there is not that secure.
